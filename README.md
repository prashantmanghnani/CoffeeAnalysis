# Coffee Quality Dashboard

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze coffee quality and related factors, using a single CSV dataset and a Power BI file. Below are the details of the project:

## Files Included
1. **Data File:** 
   - Contains information about coffee quality, origin, processing methods, defects, and timestamps.
2. **Dashboard File:** `
   - Power BI file with the developed dashboard for analysis.

## Project Overview
The Coffee Quality Dashboard provides insights into:
- Coffee quality ratings based on origin and processing methods.
- Defects and their impact on quality.
- Time series trends for coffee quality over specific periods.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** 
  - Handled using Power Query in Power BI to ensure accurate and structured data.
- **Visualization:**
  - Created clear and informative charts to represent trends, comparisons, and distributions.
- **Measures:**
  - Basic measures created within Power BI to support data aggregation and analysis.

## Usage
1. Open the `coffee_quality_dashboard.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Ensure the `coffee_data.csv` file is in the same directory.
3. Refresh the data in Power BI to load the latest version of the CSV file.

## How to Explore
- Filter by origin or processing method to view their impact on coffee quality.
- Analyze defect distribution and its correlation with ratings.
- Use time series visuals to observe trends over time.

## Data Preview
Sample structure of `coffee_data.csv`:
